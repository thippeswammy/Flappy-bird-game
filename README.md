# Flappy-bird-game

🎮 Welcome to my Flappy Bird game project, developed using the Greenfoot libraries! 🐦

Between October 2018 and January 2019, I embarked on an exciting journey to bring this classic game to life. In this game, players take control of a bird, guiding it through a series of obstacles with the press of keys. With each successful maneuver, players accumulate points, aiming to beat their high score and conquer the challenge.

🕹️ Game Highlights:

Bird Navigation: Test your skills as you navigate the bird through challenging obstacles.
High Score Challenge: Compete against yourself and others to achieve the highest score.
Exhilarating Gameplay: Experience the rush of adrenaline as you strive for victory.
It's been an incredible experience developing this game, and I'm thrilled to share it with you all!
